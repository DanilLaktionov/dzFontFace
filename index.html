                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and<br>
                     the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs<br>
                      APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<em> bundles<br>
                       of reusable, nestable code.</em> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover<br>
                        how components work in React Native.</p>

                <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with<br>
                     JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get<br>
                      you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,<br>
                     approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                <p>+ JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:<br>
                     <mark class="mark">&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.</mark></p>
                <p>The React docs have<u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is<br>
                     JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark class="mark">name</mark> for the cat, name, and<br>
                      embedding it with curly braces inside <mark class="mark">&ltText&gt&lt/Text&gt</mark></p>
                <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,<br>
                     state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over<br>
                      time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText</em> prop that<br>
                     takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a<br>
                      function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language.<br>
                     In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"<br>
                      would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
